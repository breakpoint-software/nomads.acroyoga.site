    Acroyoga (also written Acro-Yoga or Acro Yoga) is a physical practice which
    combines yoga and acrobatics.[1] Acroyoga includes many types of (mostly
    recreational) partner and group acrobatics in which at least someone is
    lifted. As such it also draws on traditions of circus arts, cheer-leading,
    and dance acro. Acroyoga is more vigorous than many traditional forms of
    yoga as exercise, and may lead to more injuries. Learning Acroyoga requires
    strength training, flexibility training and technique training.[5] Strength
    training is accomplished through repetition of exercises like push-ups, hand
    walking and handstands. Flexibility training is best done at the end of a
    session with a partner.

    Learning good Acroyoga technique takes time and effort and is best learned
    with an expert teacher.[5] One important Acroyoga technique is called bone
    stacking. This involves the base partner keeping arms and legs straight to
    maximize the weight load on bones rather than muscles to support the
    flyer.[6] A typical Acro Yoga session may include:[7] Circle ceremony
    promotes communication and openness Warm-up to gradually get your muscles
    ready for more strenuous exercise Partner flow - continue warming up with
    asanas and stretching with a partner[8] Inversions help build trust between
    the partners[8] Flying and acrobatics Some communities have regular Acro
    Yoga meetings to provide a place for interested people to come together and
    practice for free, called jams. There are also larger Acro Yoga events such
    as the Dutch Acrobatics Convention, Acro SF, Vancouver Acro Festival, to
    name a few, that draw a global audience of practitioners. All over the
    world, there are instructors teaching Acro Yoga in regular classes and
    workshops. You can learn Acroyoga by yourself, but it takes time, discipline
    and responsibility, as you may not know all the techniques that will make
    the practice safe, for yourself and others.
